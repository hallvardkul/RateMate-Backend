- You do **not** have direct access to PostgreSQL.
- If you need table structures or data, write the exact **SQL query** you want me to run (e.g., `SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users';`).
- Wait for me to paste the results in chat before proceeding.
- When schema changes are required, send the full `CREATE/ALTER` statements; I will execute them and confirm.

- **Read-don't-ask**: Open and scan the relevant files/folders yourself; do not ask the user to locate lines or confirm filenames.
- **Auto-apply**: When you find an issue, apply the fix directly, save the file, and show the diff in chat.
- Request confirmation **only** if the change deletes more than 30 lines or modifies deployment / infrastructure config.
